How can we design a web page that converts audio to text, and then sends this text to the Arduino to move the robot arm left or right?

Previously, we learned how to design a website to convert audio to text , To see: [speech to text](https://github.com/alaserimaha/speech-to-text)
And also we learned how to download the Arduino IDE to write code , To see: [Getting Started With ESP32](https://github.com/alaserimaha/Getting-Started-With-ESP32)

Now to complete the project, using https://web.dev/serial/ (which helps us to connect the website to the Arduino) through some steps:

## 1. Installation - JavaScript
## 2. Installation - Arduino
## 3. JavaScript Usage
## 4. Arduino Usage
